This is an attempt to mavenize Jitsi and friends. *Everything* is put under the
`org.jitsi` group id. The [artifacts](artifacts/) directory contains poms for bundles that
have already been mavenized. External dependencies are either pulled from
maven, or, if they're not yet mavenized, they're installed in the local
repository so that they can be shared. 

The repository contains three POSIX compliant shell scripts :

- [mvn-extract-artifact.sh](mvn-extract-artifact.sh) extracts a bundle from the
  Jitsi codebase. It does a sparse checkout that contains only the code for the
  bundle, isolating it from the Jitsi codebase. To minimize disk and network
  usage, it shares the git objects with a complete Jitsi (SIP Communicator)
  checkout. 

- [mvn-extract-all.sh](mvn-extract-all.sh) calls the
  [mvn-extract-artifact.sh](mvn-extract-artifact.sh) for all the mavenized
   bundles in the artifacts directory.

- [mvn-install-deps.sh](mvn-install-deps.sh) installs external dependencies
  that are not found in a maven repository to the local maven repository.

Maveization of the Jitsi Videobridge and JICOFO is functional, i.e. you can mvn
compile the project (use the aggregator projects). You can also import it in
IntelliJ IDEA and it will just work (again use the aggregator projects). I've
been trying to mavenize Jitsi (SIP Communicator) and althought I have done some
progress there, it's not yet functional.

DISCLAIMER: This is a work in progress, USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. Althought I'm
affiliated with Jitsi, this is not an official effort to mavenize Jitsi, it's
just personal work that I'm sharing with whoever might be interested.

I'm not a maven expert nor a git wizard nor a shell guru, so I expect there's
lots of room for improvements. The code is ugly but it works for me.
